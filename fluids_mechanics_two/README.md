# Fluid Mechanics two
In this repository you can find a work done for the subject fluid mechanics two about the Blasius boundary layer. 
The work was done together with three classmates but the one in charge of writing the code was me.

The work consists mainly in solving a system of three differential equations. For this purpose
different methods were programmed, explained in the documentation. The work was programmed in Matlab and Octave.
