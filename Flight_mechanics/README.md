# Flight mechanics 

The purpose of this report is to develop a dynamic model for the study of an aircraft 
in rectilinear flight in subsonic regime (M â‰¤ 0.6). To perform this study, 
the three degrees of freedom model has been considered, which considers motion only 
within the vertical plane and does not consider the lateral turns and forces that produce out-of-plane motion. 
The input variables for this study will be the position of the gas lever and the deflection of the tail stabilizer.
