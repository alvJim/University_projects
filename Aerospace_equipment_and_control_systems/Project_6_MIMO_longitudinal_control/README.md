# MIMO longitudinal control

The objective will be to design a MIMO (multiple-input multiple-output) controlled system. 
For this purpose, the state vector will be fed back to control the longitudinal dynamics, choosing in each case the controlled variables. 
To carry out the design, pole assignment control, quadratic optimal control will be used and a state observer
will be included to provide the controller with integral action.
