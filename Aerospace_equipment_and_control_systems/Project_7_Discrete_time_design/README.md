# Discrete-time design

This time it is a matter of designing the lateral and longitudinal controller 
of exercises 5 and 6 using design methods for discrete time.

To do so, we have to justify the choice of the sampling period, obtain the discrete observer (predictor version), 
obtain the discrete time controller (also with integral action), make a comparison of results 
and simulate the implementation in a digital environment.
