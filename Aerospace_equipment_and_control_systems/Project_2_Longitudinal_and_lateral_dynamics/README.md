# Modes associated with longitudinal and lateral dynamics and lateral

The objective of this problem is to study the lateral and longitudinal dynamics of an aircraft and the natural modes associated with these dynamics
and the natural modes associated with these dynamics, which are the phugoid mode (PH) and the short-period mode (SP) for the longitudinal
short period (SP) for the longitudinal dynamics, and the Dutch Roll (DR), spiral (SP) and balance convergence (SP) modes.
(SP) and roll convergence (RC) for the lateral dynamics.
