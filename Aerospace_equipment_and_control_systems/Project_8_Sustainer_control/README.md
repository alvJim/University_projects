# Sustainer control

The Quanser 3-DOF sustainer is a model helicopter mounted on a fixed base 
with four propellers driven by DC motors, i.e. it is a quadcopter. 
The frame contains a large joint that allows movement with three degrees of freedom 
so the pivoting structure rotates in all three axes: roll, pitch and yaw.
