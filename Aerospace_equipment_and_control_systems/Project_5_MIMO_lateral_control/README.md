# Mimo lateral control

The objective will be to design a MIMO (multiple-input multiple-output) controller. 
For this purpose, the state vector will be fed back to control the lateral dynamics, choosing in each case the controlled variables. 
To carry out the design, we will use pole assignment control, quadratic optimal control and a state observer 
will be included to provide the controller with integral action.
