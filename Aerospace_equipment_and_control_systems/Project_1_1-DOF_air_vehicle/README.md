# 1-DOF air vehicle 

In this practice, a simulation of the flight dynamics of an aerial vehicle with 
a single degree of freedom was carried out. To be able to do this, it is necessary 
to carry out a linearization of the system. In addition, it will be necessary 
to study the open-loop stability and its range as a function of the proportional parameter kp of the controller. 
It is also requested the response of the system to different Set Point changes, and to show the Simulink performed.
