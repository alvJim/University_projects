# 1-DOF air vehicle

In this practice, a simulation of the flight dynamics of an aerial vehicle was carried out,
with a single degree of freedom. To be able to do this, it is necessary to carry out a linearization of the system.
In addition, it is necessary to study the open-loop stability and its range as a function of the proportional parameter kp of the
as a function of the proportional parameter kp of the controller. It is also required the response of the system
to different Set Point changes, and to show the Simulink realized.
