# SAS lateral (Roll Yaw Damper)

Through the design of a roll damper and a yaw damper, the lateral-directional stability of an
yaw damper will be used to increase the lateral-directional stability of an aircraft.
For this purpose:

-> There will be two types of speeds, the yaw angular yaw rate r that feeds back to the rudder.
feedback to the rudder δr to modify the roll mode of the dutchman (DR), 
and the roll rate p that feeds back to the ailerons δa to modify the roll toe-in mode.

-> A multivariate analysis has to be performed, for which there are 2 inputs (ailerons and rudder) and 2 or more outputs (ailerons and rudder).
Since lateral (roll) and directional (yaw) movements are coupled.
