# CRM 2D Viscous results

In this folder different simulations have been performed for the NASA Common Research Model profile, better known by its acronym CRM.
The profile belongs to 65% of the half-wing (being 0% the fuselage and 100% the tip of the half-wing).

The simulations have been performed for viscous flow.
Inside the folder you can find different postfixes for the files, being these:

---------Postfixes referring to the mesh:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-> S1: Domain size of 10 points.
-> S2: Domain size of 40 points.
-> S3: Domain size of 160 points.
-> S4: Domain size of 640 points.

->N1: 48 points on the profile and 30 on the domain.
->N2: 96 points on the profile and 60 on the domain.
->N3: 192 points on the profile and 120 on the domain.
->N4: 384 points on the profile and 240 on the domain.

->Y0= wall spacing of 7.8e-6
->Y2= wall spacing of 4.5e-6

----------Postfixes referring to experimentation:-------------------------------------------------------------------------
