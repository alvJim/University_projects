# CRM 3D Non viscous results

In this folder different simulations have been performed for the 3D half of the aircraft of the NASA Common Research Model, 
better known by its acronym CRM. 

The simulation has been performed for non-viscous flow.
Inside the folder you can find different postfixes for the files, being these:

-> FP: full plane
-> V3: version 3, since it took several versions to find the solution.
