# CRM 2D Non Viscous Results

In this folder different simulations have been performed for the NASA Common Research Model (CRM) profile. 
Common Research Model of NASA, better known by its acronym CRM.

The profile belongs to 65% of the half-wing (being 0% the fuselage and 100% the tip of the half-wing).

The simulations have been performed for non-viscous flow.
Inside the folder you can find different postfixes for the files, being these:

---------Postfixes referring to the mesh:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-> S1: Domain size of 10 points.
-> S2: Domain size of 40 points.
-> S3: Domain size of 160 points.
-> S4: Domain size of 640 points.

->N1: 48 points on the profile and 30 on the domain.
->N2: 96 points on the profile and 60 on the domain.
->N3: 192 points on the profile and 120 on the domain.
->N4: 384 points on the profile and 240 on the domain.

->Y0= wall spacing of 7.8e-6
->Y2= wall spacing of 4.5e-6
